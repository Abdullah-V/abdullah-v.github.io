    <h2 class="section-title">~ LITTLE HISTORY</h2>
    <p>
      I am from (link to google maps) Baku, Azerbaijan. I spent my childhood
      mostly in Baku city and sometimes in villages of (link to google maps)
      Nakhchivan. I consider myself lucky to have spent my childhood both in the
      city and in the village. These taught me a lot of experiences about life.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since then, I have been interested in many, many subjects. I spent my days
      in libraries reading on many topics that interested me, from mathematics
      to history. The main breaking point for me was meeting the internet. I was
      curious about everything I saw on the internet, trying to learn everything
      in depth (I think I am still).
      <br />
      <br />
      ...and i start to programming in 2020. Firstly i learn the fundamentals of
      some programming languages and try to understand the logic/philosophy of
      programming languages. Then i start to learn some elementary CS concepts.
      I just like go down to rabbit hole.
